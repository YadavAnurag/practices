[⬆] Cors- 
cross origin resource sharing to share resource on diff domains

[⬆] React- 16.13.0
React is a front-end JavaScript library developed by Facebook in 2011.
It follows the component based approach which helps in building reusable UI components.
It is used for developing complex and interactive web and mobile UI.
package contains only the functioality necessary to define react component. typically used together with React renderer like react-dom for web and react native for mobile platform.
Key Features-
    virtual DOM
    Server Side rendering
    unidirectional data binding
    client side routing

⬆] NoSQL:
referring to non SQL or non relational is a database that provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data. This data is modeled in documents other than the tabular relations used in relational databases. 

Types of NoSQL databases?
Document Stores (MongoDB, Couchbase)
Key-Value Stores (Redis, Volgemort)
Column Stores (Cassandra)
Graph Stores (Neo4j, Giraph)
Problem----
    transaction
    large document size

[⬆] ACID-
Atomicity - entire transaction takes place at once or does not happen at all
Consistency - database must be consistent before and after transaction
Isolation - multiple transaction occur independently without interference
Durability - the changes of a successfull transaction occurs even if the system failure occurs

[⬆] Scalability:
Horizontal and vertical scaling.
How to scale database? (Data partitioning, sharding(vertical/horizontal), replication(master-slave, master-master)).

[⬆] CAP Theorem-
The theorem specifies some kind of an upper limit when designing distributed systems.
"You can have at most two of these properties for any shared-data system."

Consistency - consistent view of data in distributed system
Availability - demands the system to eventually answer every request even in case of failure
Partition Tolerance -  This property describes the fact that the system is resilient to message losses between nodes. A partition is an arbitrary split between nodes of a system, resulting in complete message loss in between. 

[⬆] Cache:
What is write-through and write-behind caching? (write-through (synchronous), write-behind (asynchronous))


[⬆] Life Cycle-
Mounting
    constructor
    getDerivedStateFromProps
    render
    componentDidMount
Updating
    getDerivedStateFromProps
    shouldComponentUpdate
    render
    getSnapshotBeforeUpdate
